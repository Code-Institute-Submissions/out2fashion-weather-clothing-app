# OUT2FASHION - Clothing App Using Weather API Data

Code Institute - Milestone Project 2 - Interactive Frontend Development

OUT2FASHION is a mobile-first one-page web application that helps women stay stylish every day based on the clothing items they might need according to the weather forecast. The primary purpose of this web app is to inform the users about the daily weather forecasts in a fun and interactive way and to serve as a guidance in combining relevant clothing items for their outfit of the day. The secondary purpose is to give fashion brands an additional chance to market their products and to potentially increase the sales by using third-party data in order to provide relevant shopping suggestions the users will love.

## UX

A few months ago I've dived into the online shopping behaviour in fashion and apparel industry. I've found several interesting studies and research that helped me understand the user journey and motives of online fashion shoppers. Here are a few facts I've decided to highlight.

Recent research shows that [1 out of 5 buyers](https://www.oliverwyman.com/content/dam/oliver-wyman/v2/publications/2018/july/Oliver%20Wyman_Understanding%20Behavior%20of%20Apparel%20Shopper.pdf) choose to shop online for clothes while 78% of these online shoppers shop exclusively online. It might not seem as a big number but this is because the study has been done on a sample of buyers belonging to all age groups from 18 to 56+. These frequent online fashion shoppers tend to be younger in age - people in their late twenties and early thirties. This leaves us with young working adults who are either starting their careers or already upgrading their financial status by work promotions.

In addition, according to another research, [online apparel retail customers](https://www.retailcustomerexperience.com/blogs/examining-the-online-apparel-retail-customer-experience/) spend 30 minutes to an hour browsing. Those who spend more time doing so are likely to result in a purchase in order to avoid wasted efforts. I found this very insightful and it reminded me of the sunk cost fallacy, a key concept in behavioral economics. It made me wonder if this is also the reason why, as Shopify states, [the average return rate in e-commerce is 20%](https://www.shopify.com/enterprise/ecommerce-returns) causing the return reasons such as "changed my mind" in apparel industry.

Due to the fact that the higher basket value reduces or eliminates the shipping costs, I wasn't very surprised to read that [on average, apparel shoppers purchase up to three apparel items in one sitting](https://www.retailcustomerexperience.com/blogs/examining-the-online-apparel-retail-customer-experience/). However, it did make me realise the importance of a wide selection of products, product categories and price ranges to encourage the full-basket checkouts.

The last super interesting information I've come across in two different reports is the fact that up to 90% of apparel shoppers are repeat buyers (accordiing to [Oliver Wyman](https://www.oliverwyman.com/our-expertise/insights/2018/jan/understanding-the-2017-apparel-shopper-journey.html) and [Stitch Fix](https://www.wired.com/story/stitch-fix-shop-your-looks/)). While Stitch Fix decided to benefit from this behaviour by personalised recommendations of 1000+ brands, I see this as an opportunity for individual brands or a few brands with similar style to increase their sales. It's not uncommon for people to identify their style with an already existing brand. Mine would be in that case brands like [Esprit](https://www.esprit.com/) and [Tom Tailor](https://www.tom-tailor.com/).

Having these (and many other) facts in mind that I've found, I've decided to build a mobile web app that
